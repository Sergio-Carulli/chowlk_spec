## 1. Introduction
This document describes Chowlk, a visual notation specification to construct ontological diagrams. It provides a set of visual blocks to represent each element from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/">OWL</a> ontology implementation language. The specification allows the representation of high-level as well as fine-grained constructs from the OWL language, giving the user the freedom to choose the level of expresiveness for their conceptualization. In order to use the visual blocks from this specification you could also your favourite diagraming tool but we recomend using <a href="https://www.draw.io/">drawio</a> as the following resources are available for working with <a href="https://www.draw.io/">drawio</a>.

<!--The visual notation specification comes with the following resources: -->

* <a href="resources/chowlk-drawio-library.xml" download>Chowlk Library</a>: This drawio library contains the whole set of visual blocks detailed in this document.
* <a href="https://chowlk.herokuapp.com/">Code Generation Service</a>: A web service to automatically generate the OWL code of your ontology if you follow this specification.
