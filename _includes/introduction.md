## 1. Introduction
This document describes Chowlk, a visual notation specification to construct ontological diagrams. It provides a set of visual blocks to represent each element from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/">OWL</a> language. The specification allows the representation of high-level as well as fine-grained constructs from the OWL language, giving the user the freedom to choose the level of expresiveness for their conceptualization. In order to use the visual blocks from our specification you should use <a href="https://www.draw.io/">drawio</a> as your diagramming tool.

The specification comes with the following resources:

* <a href="resources/chowlk-drawio-library.xml" download>Chowlk Library</a>: This drawio library contains the whole set of visual blocks detailed in this document.
* <a href="https://chowlk.herokuapp.com/">Code Generation Service</a>: A web service to automatically generate the OWL code of your ontology if you follow this specification.
